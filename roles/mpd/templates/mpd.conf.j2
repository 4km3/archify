# Audio Output ################################################################
#
# MPD supports various audio output types, as well as playing through multiple 
# audio outputs at the same time, through multiple audio_output settings 
# blocks. Setting this block is optional, though the server will only attempt
# autodetection for one sound card.
#
# See <http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Configuration#Audio_Outputs> for examples of 
# other audio outputs.
#
# An example of an ALSA output:
#
audio_output {
	type		"alsa"
	name		"My ALSA Device"
	#device		"hw:0,0"	# optional
	#format		"44100:16:2"	# optional
	format		"48000:16:2"	# optional
	mixer_device	"hw:0"	# optional
	mixer_control	"PCM"		# optional
	mixer_index	"0"		# optional
}

#audio_output {
#    type                    "fifo"
#    name                    "my_fifo"
#    path                    "/tmp/mpd.fifo"
#    format                  "48000:16:2"
#}
